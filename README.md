# Power-Automate-Error-Email-Handler

It is often important to know straight away when a flow fails.
This is a way to receive an email as soon as it happens.
It is valuable to set the status of the flow as failed on purpose when analysing flow runs afterwards.

The configuration makes it work as intended.
This step will only run when the previous step fails or it is skipped.
A step is skipped when a previous step in the flow fails so unless we select that option, we will not be informed every time the flow fails.
